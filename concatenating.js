// Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
// Concatenate means to link together. Think of the ’+’ operator like a chain linking strings together; add the strings just like you add numbers. Make sure your spelling is correct! Take note of spaces between words.

var str = "Good " + "job!" // It says "Good job!"
var abc = "Good" + "job!" // It says "Goodjob!"

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";

// Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
// The ’+=’ operator can concatenate (link) strings easily. Make sure your spelling is right, and you’ve left appropriate spaces.

var str = "Hello ";
str += "coding"; // Now the string reads "Hello coding"
str += "camper!"; // And now the string reads "Hello codingcamper!"

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Paul";
var myStr = "My name is "+myName+" and I am well!";
